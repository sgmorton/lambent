Modular lighting animation using MQTT

USE CASE : Interior Lighting in a Tesla

Description: 
I want to have some animated RGB LEDs on the interior of my Tesla
Under dash, doors 1 thru 4, under seats.

Concept:

Raspi0W : The Raspi will run a Mosquito server and act as the adhoc wifi hub. 
In addition to this there will be a website accesible for control of animations and configuration.

Arduino Uno : The Uno will handle the heavy lifting. All animations will be controlled on the Uno as if it were one large array of LEDs.
Each frame of the (SHOWLED) would then be chopped into small parts coresponding to the arrays in each location (doors etc...) as each
new array piece is chopped it's published to the Mosquito server where each individual controller is subbed. 
The Uno may also have a bluetooth dongle for control.

ESP8266 : these will be located in each of the locations. They will subscribe to thier particular node on the Mosquito server and upon
reciept of a pub will light the LEDs on thier array according to the payload. There will need to be a way to configure these remotely as 
will not be easily accessible once installed.
